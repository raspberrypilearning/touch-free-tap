## Mount the distance sensor


Create a small, splash-resistant mount so that the ultrasonic sensor faces downwards.


--- task ---
Cut a small piece of plastic or print a bracket that can hold the ultrasonic sensor level, and add a short 'hood' so that any water splashes do not hit the sensor. Make sure that the bracket will keep the sensor at least 6–8cm above the expected water level.

--- task ---
Mark and drill two holes in the bracket so that you can use screws or zip ties to secure the sensor.


**Safety Note:** Wear safety glasses, tie back long hair, keep hands away from sharp or moving parts, and only use drills or sharp tools with close adult help and care.

--- task ---
Securely attach the bracket to a safe stand or mock basin. Make sure that no conductive parts could short the Raspberry Pi Pico or relay.

This example uses recycled plastic containers, cardboard, and a bucket as a simple prototype:

The sensor connects to a Raspberry Pi Pico on a breadboard with a relay and power supply in a tray across the top. A DC pump in the water feeds the tap through a plastic tube.](images/bucket-tap-diagram.png)
