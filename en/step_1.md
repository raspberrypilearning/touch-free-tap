## What you will make

Build a **Touchless Water Tap** that uses a Raspberry Pi Pico, the `picozero` library, an ultrasonic sensor, a relay, and a 12 V solenoid valve. When hands are detected within a set distance, the relay opens the valve; when hands move away, it closes.

**You will need**
- Raspberry Pi Pico flashed with MicroPython
- Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04
- Single-channel 5 V relay module
- 12 V DC solenoid water valve + 12 V DC supply
- Breadboard, jumper wires
- 2 resistors for a safe Echo divider (e.g., 1 kΩ to Pico, 470 Ω to GND)
- USB cable for Pico
- Optional: LED indicator, flow sensor, 3D-printed splash hood
