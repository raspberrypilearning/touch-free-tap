## What you will make

Build a **Touchless Water Faucet** that uses a Raspberry Pi Pico, the `picozero` library, an ultrasonic sensor, a relay, and a 12 V solenoid valve. When hands are detected within a set distance, the relay opens the valve; when hands move away, it closes.

**You will need**
- **Raspberry Pi Pico** — microcontroller for running the system
- **Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (HC-SR04)** — detects hand distance for touchless control
- **5 V Single-Channel Relay Module** — electrically isolates and switches the pump on/off  
- **Mini DC Water Pump Module (5–12 V)** — substitutes for a solenoid valve to control water flow
- **External DC Supply (5–12 V)** — to power the water pump  
- **Arduino USB Power (5 V)** — to power logic circuits
- **Breadboard and jumper wires** — for temporary circuit assembly
- **2 resistors (e.g., 1 kΩ and 470 Ω)** — for the ECHO pin voltage divider  

### Optional Enhancements

- **LED Indicator** — visual cue for pump activation.  
- **Buzzer Module** — audio cue when sensor detects a hand  
- **Housing or splash guard** — fabricated from recycled materials, or with a 3D printer
